# Guava

This is a library with a fast and minimal memory-consuming hashing function also known as Jump [Consistent Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing) from the original work "A Fast, Minimal Memory, Consistent Hash Algorithm" by Google (see [1406.2294v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2294v1.pdf)).

> In comparison to the algorithm of Karger et al., jump consistent hash requires no storage, is faster, and does a better job of evenly dividing the key
space among the buckets and of evenly dividing the workload when the number of buckets changes.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  guava:
    github: creadone/guava
```

Then run `shards install`.

## Usage

```crystal
require "guava"

Guava.jump(7234672323_u64, 12_i32) # => 9
```

## Tests

### Data distribution

```crystal
require "guava"

ary = Array.new(10){ Array.new(1){ 0 } }
values = (0_u64..1_000_000_u64).to_a

values.each do |i|
  num = Guava.jump(i, 10_i32)
  ary[num].push 0
end

ary.each_with_index do |cell, idx|
  puts [idx, cell.size]
end
```

**Result**

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100001 | 100001 | 100022 | 100004 | 99960 | 100058 | 99945 | 100070 | 99957 | 99992 |

### CPU time to call

> 3,6 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i3, Mac Mini 2018

```crystal
values = (0_u64..1_000_000_u64).to_a

puts Benchmark.measure {
  values.values do |i|
    Guava.jump(i, 10_i32)
  end
}
```
**Result**

| User CPU | System CPU | Sum of previous | Elapsed real time |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| 0.027966  | 0.000021  | 0.027987  | 0.028015 |
